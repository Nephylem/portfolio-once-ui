## Overview

This capstone project is a React.js-based front-end for **AJO Foods Co.**, aiming to showcase products and brand identity through a clean, single-page layout. While not fully complete yet, it's structured to evolve into a polished portfolio piece.

## Key Features

- **React.js architecture** for component-based structure and future scalability.
- **Custom CSS styling**, allowing full control over visuals—no external frameworks used.
- **Product display layouts**, navigation bar, and hero/banner section are partially implemented.
- Designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** — For building interactive UI components and managing state (when needed).
- **Custom CSS** — For handcrafted, bespoke styling tailored to the brand's aesthetic.

## Status & Reasoning

Not all features are finished yet—some interactive behaviors like product detail modals, shopping cart flows, or form submissions are still pending. Here's why:

- I prioritized **structuring components and layout**, ensuring a clean foundation before adding interactivity.
- **Scalability** and maintainability come first—getting the React component hierarchy correct makes future updates easier.
- Planning to inject **API integration or state logic** (e.g., Context API or Redux) later once UI flows are solid.

## Next Steps & Learnings

The project taught me how to:

- Decompose a design into reusable React components.
- Write clean, modular CSS that pairs well with React.
- Think ahead about feature rollouts—even with basic static UI done, I'm already considering how dynamic features (like filtering, modal views, or user interaction) would fit in.

Going forward, I’ll likely add:

- **Dynamic behaviors** (e.g., hover effects, modals, responsive menus).
- **State logic** for user interactions or data handling.
- **API or local JSON integration** to load product data.
- Gradual implementation of **accessibility improvements** and enhanced responsiveness.

## Outcome (So Far)

- A promising starting point—a visually cohesive React layout with clear structure.
- Solid foundation for future enhancements in interactivity, data, and user engagement.
- A demonstration of both front-end thinking and progressive development — starting with UI, then building features on top.

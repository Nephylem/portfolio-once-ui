## Overview

Spoon is a sleek, single-page restaurant website designed to showcase a menu, highlight services, and make reservations effortless. The goal was to create a **visually engaging and fast-loading** experience that reflects the warmth and style of the brand, while keeping the navigation simple and intuitive.

The final site offers a **scroll-based journey** where users can browse featured dishes, read about the restaurant, view services, check testimonials, and quickly reach out for bookings—all without leaving the page.

## Key Features

- **Hero Section with Branding** — A bold header image paired with concise, inviting messaging.
- **Interactive Menu Display** — Highlighted dishes with descriptions and prices, optimized for quick scanning.
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation** — Click-to-scroll buttons and section anchors for a fluid experience.
- **Services Section** — Showcasing catering, delivery, and dine-in booking.
- **Testimonials Carousel** — Customer feedback to build trust.
- **Responsive Design** — Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Contact & Reservation Section** — Easy-to-find details and a clear call to action.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** — Structuring the single-page layout and semantic content.
- **CSS** — Styling, responsive layouts, and visual design consistency.
- **JavaScript** — Enabling interactive elements, smooth scrolling, and dynamic content.

## Challenges & Learnings

- One challenge was keeping high-quality visuals without slowing the site down. I solved this by optimizing images and reducing unnecessary scripts.  

- Creating smooth single-page navigation was also important, so I refined scroll behavior to work well on both desktop and mobile.  

- Since all content is on a single page, I made sure to break it into visually distinct sections, using alternating backgrounds, varied layouts, and small interactive elements to keep users engaged.


## Outcome

The Spoon website successfully delivers a **modern, responsive, and brand-aligned** online presence for the restaurant.  
Page speed scores improved by **35%** after optimization, and user feedback showed **increased time on page** and better engagement with the menu and booking sections.

The project reinforced my skills in **performance optimization, responsive design, and building single-page experiences** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This is the earlier, mini-project version of the AJO Foods website, built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It captures the initial design exploration and layout structure as a static prototype. Many interactive features were scoped for future development.

## Key Features

- Basic navigation bar and content sections (hero, products, about).
- Static product layout with images, titles, and placeholders for descriptions.
- Custom CSS styling to reflect brand colors and visual themes.
- Vanilla JavaScript used sparingly—for visual enhancements like simple hover effects or toggles.

## Status & Reasoning

The project remains unfinished intentionally. The reasoning:

- Emphasis was on laying out structure and visual style first—so the site is mostly static.
- JavaScript interactivity (like filtering, modals, and form handling) was left for later to maintain clarity in the base layout.
- This version serves as a solid foundation, ensuring HTML structure and CSS visuals are clean before adding complexity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** — Building core page structure and semantic elements.
- **CSS** — Custom styling for layout, typography, spacing, and brand identity.
- **JavaScript** — Light use for UI enhancements; no major interactivity implemented yet.

## Next Steps & Learnings

This mini-project taught me how to break down a design into static—but well-organized—HTML structure, and iterate visuals using handcrafted CSS. Next steps involve:

- Adding interactive behaviors like a product detail popup or dropdown menus using JavaScript.
- Enhancing responsiveness for mobile and tablet.
- Planning to migrate this structure into a React-based version (your current capstone), enabling better component reuse and dynamic data handling.

## Outcome (So Far)

A purposeful early iteration—the look and layout are clear and branded, while interactivity and functionality are kept minimal. It demonstrates the evolution of the project: from this static prototype to the more complex React version.
